Python 3.9.7
You need to install pygame to run this program and you can use it as you want

Here is a program that I made for fun and for learning how to use pygame. This program greatly inspired by 
https://github.com/Harrelix/Minesweeper/tree/master (this is where i found the sprites of the tiles!)

I have enhanced this version by adding the double left-click revealing surrounding cells when we flagged enough bombs around
(see https://xn--dmineur-bya.eu/) and i implemented auto reroll when the first tile we l-click and/or its neighbours are bombs

TODO: 
- Improve GUI
- Add the double r-click that shows a question mark (maybe)
- Optimise code (hehe oops)
