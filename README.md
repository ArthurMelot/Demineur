Python 3.9.7
You need to install pygame to run this program

Here is a program that I made for fun and for learning how to use pygame. This program greatly inspired by 
https://github.com/Harrelix/Minesweeper/tree/master (this is where i found the sprites of the tiles!)

TODO: -Add an auto-reroll of the grid if the first click is a bomb/a number != 0
- Add the left-click on already clicked tiles if bombs around are flagged to reveal all its neighbours
